    "* Neutral words, which don't really convey any sentiment because you would expect to see them in all sorts of reviews – like \"the\" – have values very close to 1. A perfectly neutral word – one that was used in exactly the same number of positive reviews as negative reviews – would be almost exactly 1. The `+1` we suggested you add to the denominator slightly biases words toward negative, but it won't matter because it will be a tiny bias and later we'll be ignoring words that are too close to neutral anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, the ratios tell us which words are used more often in postive or negative reviews, but the specific values we've calculated are a bit difficult to work with. A very positive word like \"amazing\" has a value above 4, whereas a very negative word like \"terrible\" has a value around 0.18. Those values aren't easy to compare for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right now, 1 is considered neutral, but the absolute value of the postive-to-negative rations of very postive words is larger than the absolute value of the ratios for the very negative words. So there is no way to directly compare two numbers and see if one word conveys the same magnitude of positive sentiment as another word conveys negative sentiment. So we should center all the values around netural so the absolute value fro neutral of the postive-to-negative ratio for a word would indicate how much sentiment (positive or negative) that word conveys.\n",
    "* When comparing absolute values it's easier to do that around zero than one. \n",

    "> * For any postive words, convert the ratio using `np.log(ratio)`\n",
    "> * For any negative words, convert the ratio using `-np.log(1/(ratio + 0.01))`\n",
    "\n",
    "That second equation may look strange, but what it's doing is dividing one by a very small number, which will produce a larger positive number. Then, it takes the `log` of that, which produces numbers similar to the ones for the postive words. Finally, we negate the values by adding that minus sign up front. In the end, extremely positive and extremely negative words will have positive-to-negative ratios with similar magnitudes but oppositite signs."

    "# Project 5: Making our Network More Efficient<a id='project_5'></a>\n",
    "**TODO:** Make the `SentimentNetwork` class more efficient by eliminating unnecessary multiplications and additions that occur during forward and backward propagation. To do that, you can do the following:\n",
    "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
    "* Remove the `update_input_layer` function - you will not need it in this version.\n",
    "* Modify `init_network`:\n",
    ">* You no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`\n",
    ">* You will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so create `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero\n",
    "* Modify `train`:\n",
    ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.\n",
    ">* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
    ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
    "* Modify `run`:\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* Much like you did in `train`, you will need to pre-process the `review` so you can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review."
